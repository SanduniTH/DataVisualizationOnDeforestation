# DataVisualizationOnDeforestation
This is a data visualization project I did in my University. The aim was to create a website with three Data visualizations. 
For the First Visualization, the data was obtained from https://www.wri.org/blog/2019/04/world-lost-belgium-sized-area-primary-rainforests-last-yea. The data was regarding the top 10 countries that lost the most Tropical Primary Rainforest in 2018. Therefore, several dataset variables were created and the data was typed in the form of an array since then, the data could be used conveniently when creating the visualization.

For the second visualization, a CSV file was downloaded from https://ourworldindata.org/forests and the data were arranged.
Since only the values of the years 2000 and 2015 were needed, the values of every country in theyears 2005 and 2010 were deleted.

Finally, for the third visualization, the values from the third website link were copied. The data was copied to an excel sheet and the Tree cover column was removed, as only the values of the first two columns were needed and it was saved as a CSV file.
