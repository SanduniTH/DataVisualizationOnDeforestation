  <h1>DEFORESTATION</h1>
    <p>Deforestation is the permanent removal of trees to make room for something besides forest. This can include clearing the land for agriculture or grazing, or using the timber for fuel, construction or manufacturing.</p>

    <h2> Top 10 countries losing the most Tropical Primary Rainforest in 2018</h2>

    <p>The top ten countries losing the most Tropical Primary Rainforest in 2018 is shown in the graph.</p>

    <div id="BarChart"></div>
    <p>According to the above graph we can see that the country that is losing the most Tropical Primary Rainforest in 2018 is Brazil. It has lost 1,1347,132 ha. This is a very high value compared to the second country losing the most tropical Primary rainforest, The Democratic Republic of Congo, which has a value of 481,248 ha. Therefore we will focus more towards forest loss in Brazil later. From Colombia to Cameroon, these countries fall into a small range. Cameroon has the lowest out of the top 10 countries. It has lost 57,935 ha of Tropical Primary Rainforest, which is also a very high value.</p>

    <p>Therefore, it is visible that the world is losing a higher amount of Tropical Primary Rainforest than we are aware of. People should focus their attention towards this and take a step to minimise deforestation.</P>

    <h2>Forest cover by country</h2>

    <p>Next we will be focusing on all the countries overall. In the diagram below there are two world maps. The top world map shows the percentage of forest land area of every country in the year 2000, while in the second map it shows the percentage of forest land area of every country in the year 2015.</p>

    <p>Hover over the country to see the percentage of forest cover</p>

    <h2>2000</h2>
    <div id="WorldMap1"></div>
    <h2>2015</h2>
    <div id="WorldMap2"></div>

    <p>As we can see that most countries have reduced their forest cover in the last 15 years. If we focus on Brazil, in 2000 there was a forest cover of 62.37%. But in the year 2015, it was reduced to 59.05%. Most countries have at least reduced their forest cover in 1%. While some countries have worked on reforestation and have increased their forest cover. An example of such a country is China. In the year 2000, China only had 18.78% of forest cover. But after 15 years, they have increased their forest cover up to 22.1%. We should also learn from Countries such as China and reduce deforestation and focus on reforestation.</p>

    <h2>Primary forest loss in Brail</h2>

    <p>Lastly we will focus on the brazil rainforest. Brazil has one of the largest forest cover in the world. Yet every year the forest cover keeps reducing for many reasons, which is very heartbreaking to witness. Brazil's primary forest loss in 2018 is lower than 2016-2017 which occured due to the fires. Yet the value is high compared years before 2016.</p>

  <p> From above all data, we can see that we have lost a very high amount of forest land, and we continue to lose more everyday. If we don't focus more on  this environmental crisis, our future generations will suffer. Therefore it is a must that every human being focus on this crisis and take every step they can to prevent this and begin reforestation.</p>
